What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-it creates a new hidden file where it's saved all the changes that you make when you do a commit, and because it will get track of everithing you do.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-in the staging area you can do all the changes you want without making a commit and having all the chages in the repository, just when you are sure of what you do you then use the commit to put it in the repository.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-just adding one file per logical change tne commiting and then keep doing that until all the changes have been commited.
