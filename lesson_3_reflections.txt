When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you want to other people to cooperate or contribute to your work or when you want your code to be public and anyone can use it.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Because in the project maybe you're working with other people that may change something is important for you to have it in your code so you need to see which changes are in the repository to know what you have to change.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Forks is when you clone a repository in GitHub without the help of Git, clone is when you copy a repository from GitHub or in your own computer to change it locally and branches are a repository with commits who are experimentals or specials but you don't want those changes in your master branch.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-It's more easy to know the differences between your code and the repository code
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-With a USB or something that can help with the collaboration of a program, it would be more harder to make a merge without being in the same place and would be more easier to do a project by yourself.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-If you do a change in a separate branch when you pull the repository it won't lose your changes like if you do that in your local master branch or try to merge the changes and make it more difficult for you to understand the changes.
